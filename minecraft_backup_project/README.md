Minecraft Backup Project

This was a personal project that I started before Multiverse but completed during my time at Multiverse. It is a terminal application that is designed to read a log file generated by the Minecraft server application. With the information provided in the log file it can determine if the server is being used. If users are active in the server for over an hour the program will schedule a backup of the game and save it to a designated place on the machine every Saturday night. If the server is not being used, the program will not make any backups to avoid taking up space with a number of duplicate backups
