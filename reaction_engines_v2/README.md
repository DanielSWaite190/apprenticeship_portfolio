Reaction Engines V2

For this project, I wanted to test my understanding of class components. When I wrote the first version of the Reaction Engines project, I built all the components as functional components. For this version, I rewrote all the components as class components. The goal was to keep all the same functionality and even general code setup but just with class components. I also had a chance to give the site a more modern look. I was able to change a few elements based on some of the lessons I learned styling the first site.
