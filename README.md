# About Me

This is a collection of a few of the projects I worked on during my Multiverse apprenticeship, including one side project I did on my own. The projects here will demonstrate my grasp of the different languages used in each project. They will demonstrate my understanding of the different libraries and frameworks that weâ€™re used in each project and they will highlight my ability to bring these skills together to make a real site.
